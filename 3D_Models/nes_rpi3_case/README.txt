# Summary

### This is yet another **Nintendo NES Raspberry Pi** Case.

I know there already are some other cool models here on thingiverse, but i wanted to create my own version.

I have used the **original dimensions** of the NES and scaled them to **1:2**. I have tried to match the original design as close as possible.

The case is designed for the **Raspberry Pi 3**, but i think the **Raspberry Pi 2 Model B** should also fit (i did not test this !).

I have one to please you:
* if you like this model: please click the *like this thing* button
* if you have some questions or suggestions, please leave a comment
* if you have printed this model: please share some pictures in *i made one*
* if you want to support me you can do the things above and/or use the *Tip Designer* button ;)

### Modular design

There are some **extensions** planned for the future. That's why i have made some parts interchangeable:
* The first planned extension is a bottom front cover with slots for **2 USB ports**.
* The next extension will be a buttons cover with **real push buttons and a status LED**.
* I have some vague ideas about an insert for a fan.
* I am waiting for your comments for more cool ideas...

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK2S
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2 mm
Infill: 20% Honeycomb

Notes: 
Most parts need support.

I recommend using 4 perimeters, 4 bottom layers and 5 top layers.

The top parts have to be printed upside down. The STL files already come in the right orientation.
